# Tabletop Prototype

We made a larger and more sturdy prototype out of wood to enable continued indoor playtesting and experimentation.
The original prototype was too delicate to withstand more than a few games and also too lightweight (it would move around a lot in play).
The increased size should make threading the strings a lot less fiddly, so that turns are quicker and players will remain more engaged.
This is currently ~85% ready. We will probably drill holes in the posts in order to keep the strings in place during play.
